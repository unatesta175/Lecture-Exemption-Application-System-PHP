## 🎯 Project Overview

**ELEAS (E-Learning Exemption Application System)** is a web-based platform that digitizes the class/lecture exemption application process at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). Developed during an internship in collaboration with the **Academic Affairs Department (Hal Ehwal Akademik)**, this system replaces traditional paper-based workflows with an efficient, transparent digital solution.

### 🌟 Key Objectives
- Digitize the exemption application process
- Streamline multi-level approval workflows
- Enhance transparency and real-time tracking
- Reduce processing time and paperwork

## 📚 Project Story

### 🚀 The Beginning

This project emerged from a real need at UiTM's Academic Affairs Department. Students faced a cumbersome paper-based process for class exemptions involving multiple signatures, physical document routing, and unclear status tracking. ELEAS was created to solve these challenges through digital transformation.

### 👥 Team & Collaboration

The project was developed by a **two-person team** with specialized roles:



#### **Muhammad Ilyas Bin Amran** - Lead Developer & System Analyst
- 📝 Converted requirements into comprehensive technical documentation
- 🎨 Single-handedly designed complete system architecture and UI/UX
- 💻 Solo implementation of entire codebase (**4.5 months**)
- 📐 Created all technical diagrams (Flowchart, Use Case, ERD, DFD)
- 🏗️ Developed combined SRS and SDD documentation

#### **Ahmad Musta'in Billah bin Mustafa** - Client Liaison & Requirements Specialist
- 🗣️ Primary contact with Academic Affairs Department
- 📊 Led sprint-by-sprint client collaboration sessions
- 🤝 Conducted requirement elicitation meetings
- 📞 Maintained continuous stakeholder communication

### 📅 Development Timeline

**Total Duration**: ~4.5 months (135 days)

1. **Planning & Analysis** - Sprint-based agile methodology with Academic Affairs Department
2. **Design Phase** - Created flowcharts, use case diagrams, ERD, DFD, and UI/UX mockups
3. **Implementation** - Full-stack solo development of all features
4. **Documentation** - Combined SRS + SDD report for final submission

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP 7.4+)
- Composer (for PHPMailer)
- Modern web browser

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone/Download Project**
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\
git clone [your-repo-url] eleas.uitm.edu.my
cd eleas.uitm.edu.my
```

2. **Create Environment File**
```bash
# Windows
copy env .env

# The env file already contains your configuration!
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd PHPMailer
composer install
cd ..
```

4. **Setup Database**
- Start XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)
- Open phpMyAdmin: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
- Create database: `eleas_v3`
- Import file: `eleas_v3.sql`

5. **Access System**
```
http://localhost/eleas.uitm.edu.my
```

### Environment Configuration

Your `.env` file contains:
- **Database**: localhost, eleas_v3, root (no password)
- **Email**: Gmail SMTP with app password
- **App Settings**: Development mode with debugging enabled

**🔒 Security Note**: For production, change `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`
