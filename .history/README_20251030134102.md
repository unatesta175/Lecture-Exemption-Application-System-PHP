# ELEAS - e-Learning Exemption Application System

A web-based application system developed for UiTM (Universiti Teknologi MARA) to manage and process student lecture exemption requests online. This system streamlines the application, validation, and approval workflow for class/lecture exemptions.

## Project Background

This project was developed during a 6-month internship program at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Segamat Campus, Johor, Malaysia, from February 2023 to August 2023. The internship was conducted under the Infostructure Department, where the primary objective was to modernize and digitalize the manual lecture exemption application process.

### The Story

Before this system was implemented, students at UiTM Segamat had to go through a lengthy manual process to apply for lecture exemptions. They needed to physically visit multiple offices, collect signatures from various lecturers and department heads, and submit paper forms. This process was time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to document loss or delays.

During the internship, the challenge was to create a comprehensive digital solution that would:
- Allow students to submit exemption applications online
- Enable lecturers to validate and approve requests digitally
- Provide program coordinators (KPP) with oversight and support validation capabilities
- Automate email notifications to keep all stakeholders informed
- Generate PDF reports for record-keeping and official documentation

The system was successfully developed and deployed, significantly reducing the processing time from several days to just a few hours. It improved transparency, accountability, and efficiency in managing student lecture exemptions.
